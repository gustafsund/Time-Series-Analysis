# Coursework from course in Time Series Analysis, Lund University, Faculty of Engineering (LTH)

This code pertains to a project where the goal was to model and predict the use of power in a Danish town. The resulting model is a Box-Jenkins model with input being outside temperature and outside water temperature. The BJ model was then further encanced by incorporating it in a Kalman filter, to track the dynamics of the system. The prediction results were compared to Facebook's Prophet API in Python. This project was done in colaboration with classmate Lovisa Bielke.
